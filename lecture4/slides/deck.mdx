# Setting up the IDE

- VSCode
  - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Sublime Text
  - https://www.sublimetext.com/

# NVM

- NVM is a node.js version manager
- It is a tool used to manage multiple active Node.js versions.
- NVM helps easily switch between multiple versions of Node.js, right from the command line.
- DOCS - https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

---

# Installing NVM

- Run any of the following commands:
  - curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
  - wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash

---

# yarn

- It stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator
- It is a package manager that help to manage a project’s dependencies.
- It was developed by Facebook to fix performance and security concerns with npm.
- Installation
  - via npm - npm install -g yarn
  - via installer - https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable
    - To check the current version - yarn --version

---

# yarn.lock

- Yarn needs to store exactly which versions of each dependency were installed.To do this Yarn uses a yarn.lock file in the root of your project.
- yarn.lock file is auto-generated and should be handled entirely by Yarn.
- As you add/upgrade/remove dependencies with the Yarn CLI, it will automatically update your yarn.lock file.

---

# package-lock

- package-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json
- It keeps track of versions of each package installed with their dependencies version also.

---

# Installing Node.js

- nvm install <SPECIFIC_NODE_VERSION> - To install specific version of node
- nvm install node - To install latest version of node
- nvm use <SPECIFIC_NODE_VERSION> - To use specific version
- From Node.js Site - https://nodejs.org/en/download/

# Chrome Debugging

# What is React.js?

- ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components.
- React was created by Jordan Walke,who was a software engineer working for Facebook.It is maintained by Facebook.
- React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page.

---

# Why React?

- ReactJS allows you to divide your entire application into various components.
- One-way Data Binding
- Virtual DOM
- Simplicity
- Performance

---

# Installing React.js

- npx create-react-app name

- cd name

- npm start

- Docs - https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html

---

# Basics of React

- One-way data binding
- State vs Props
- Virtual DOM
- Lifecycle Methods
- Understanding JSX, string template

---

# One-Way Data Binding

- ReactJS is designed in such a manner that follows unidirectional data flow or one-way data binding.
- One-way data binding will bind the data from the component to the view (DOM) or from view to the component.
- You can only bind the data from component to the view or from view to the component.

---

# State vs Props

- State

  - The state is an updatable structure that is used to contain data or information about the component and can change over time.
  - The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system event.
  - States can be used for rendering dynamic changes with the component.

- Props

  - Props are read-only components.
  - Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument.
  - Props are used to communicate between components.

---

# Virtual DOM

- DOM manipulation is a lot slower than most JavaScript operations.
- In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.”
- Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster.

---

# How Virtual DOM works

- When you render a JSX element, every single virtual DOM object gets updated.
- Once the virtual DOM has updated, then React compares the virtual DOM with a virtual DOM snapshot that was taken right before the update. By comparing the new virtual DOM with a pre-update version, React figures out exactly which virtual DOM objects have changed.
- Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates those objects, and only those objects, on the real DOM

---

# Lifyecycle methods

- In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods.
- These lifecycle methods are called at various points during a component's life.

---

#

- componentWillMount()

  - This is invoked immediately before a component gets rendered into the DOM.

- componentDidMount()

  - This is invoked immediately after a component gets rendered and placed on the DOM.
  - After this, you can do any DOM querying operations.

- render()

  - This method is defined in each and every component
  - It is responsible for returning a single root HTML node element.
  - If you don't want to render anything, you can return a null or false value.

---

#

- componentWillRecieveProps()

  - It is invoked when a component receives new props.

- shouldComponentUpdate()

  - It is invoked when a component decides any changes/updation to the DOM.
  - It allows you to control the component's behavior of updating itself.
  - If this method returns true, the component will update. Otherwise, the component will skip the updating.

---

#

- componentWillUpdate()

  - It is invoked just before the component updating occurs.

- componentDidUpdate()
  - It is invoked immediately after the component updating occurs.
  - you can put any code inside this which you want to execute once the updating occurs.
  - This method is not invoked for the initial render.

---

#

- componentWillUnmount()
  - This method is invoked immediately before a component is destroyed and unmounted permanently.
  - It performs any necessary cleanup related task such as invalidating timers, event listener, canceling network requests, or cleaning up DOM elements.

---

# JSX

- JSX stands for JavaScript Extension.
- It is a React extension which allows writing JavaScript code that looks like HTML.
- JSX provides you to write HTML like structures in the same file where you write JavaScript code
- The preprocessor will transform these expressions into actual JavaScript code.

---

# Code Maintainability/SDLC, Best Practices

---

# Eslint

- ESLint is a tool that allows us to maintain code quality and enforce code conventions.
- ESLint will not actually execute the code but will instead read through the source code to see if all the preconfigured code conventions are followed by the developers.
- Installation - yarn add eslint
- Docs - https://yarnpkg.com/package/eslint

---

# Stylelint

- A modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles.
- Installation - yarn add stylelint
- Configuration - https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/blob/16b4595496f54fa52182fafe9d75e78691b38261/docs/user-guide/get-started.md

---

# Prettier

- Prettier is an opinionated code formatter.
- It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules.
- Installation - yarn add prettier
